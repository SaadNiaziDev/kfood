				At KFood, we believe that the strength of Pakistan lies in its villages in the hands of the farmers, families,
				and communities who nurture the nation’s growth. Waseela is more than an initiative; it’s a movement to empower
				rural Pakistan through innovation, knowledge, and collaboration.
			</p>
			<p class='text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed font-body text-base md:text-lg'>
				We work as a catalyst for change, bridging the gap between data-driven research and real-world impact. By
				understanding the needs of rural communities and combining insights with practical solutions, Waseela develops
				projects that boost productivity, improve livelihoods, and foster sustainable economic growth.
